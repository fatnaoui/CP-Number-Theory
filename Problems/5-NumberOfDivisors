Problem Name: Number Of Divisors
Problem Constraints: 1 <= n <= 15
1 <= ai <= 1000000
1 <= test cases <= 10
Problem Description:
Little Bob and Mary once got into a fight over rating on codeforces.
Bob asked Mary to share her ice-cream with him if she couldn't answer the question. Mary agreed as she was so confident of herself.
Bob asked you are given a number n find its number of divisors. Mary answered it in a flash and started laughing. Bob said the question isn't over yet.
Since n can be as large as having 50 digits you are only given some numbers <= 1000000 whose product is n. Mary got a bit surprised and started working on the question.
Now you have to help Mary find the number of divisors of (a<sub>1</sub>* a<sub>2</sub>* a<sub>3</sub> ....a<sub>n</sub>) where you are given a<sub>1</sub> a<sub>2</sub> a<sub>3</sub>.. a<sub>n</sub>.
Since the answer can be large output it modulo 10^9+7.

Input Format: first line consist of number of test cases.
First line of every text case consists of integer n.
the second line consists of n integers.
