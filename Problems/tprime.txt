Problem Name: T-Prime
Problem Constraints: n <= 10^5
xi <= 10^12
Problem Description:
We know that prime numbers are positive integers that have exactly two distinct positive divisors. Similarly, we'll call a positive integer t Т-prime, if t has exactly three distinct positive divisors.

You are given an array of n positive integers. For each of them determine whether it is Т-prime or not.

Input Format: First Line : n , Number of elements in an array
Second Line : xi ( i from 1 to n)    
Sample Input: 3
4 5 6
Output Format: YES if its T-Prime
NO if its not a T-Prime
Sample Output: YES
NO
NO

Solution:
If you think that a three divisor number is the square of a prime number,
for example 49 has only 1,49 and 7 so each prime its square is the one of the solution
