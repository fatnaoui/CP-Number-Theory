Problem Name: Multiplicative Inverse
Problem Constraints: 1<=n<=1000000
Problem Description:
Given a number n. Print the multiplicative inverse of “n modulo 1000000007” .

Input Format: Single line containing an integer value.
Sample Input: 3

Output Format: Integral value representing the multiplicative inverse.
Sample Output: 333333336

Solution: using the usual method won't work because if n=20 we already reach out 10 ^18.

We know that m = 1000000007 is a prime number so n^(m-1) = 1 mod(m)

so n^(m-2)*n = 1 mod(m)

so the multiple inverse is n^(m-2) which can be calculated using exponentail method
