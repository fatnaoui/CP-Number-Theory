## Prime Factor
-------------------
- If you wanna get all the prime devisors of a number n, you can use the simple method 
(iterating until n ) which time O(n) in time complexity.
- Instead of that you each time you find a prime devisor update the n by sqrt(n) which
gives us O(sqrt(n)) in time complexity.
