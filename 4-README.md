Fining the prime numbers between large numbers is one the problem where sieve method can help but in different approach.
Assuming that n-m is less or equal to 10^8 so that we can appilicate this method.
In some editors like coding blocks ide, i got time limit so i'm working on developing this code.
So if you come with any approach tha tcan help just lemme know.
