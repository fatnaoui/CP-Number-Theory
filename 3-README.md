## Large primes
It's not possible to use sieve method when working with numbers greather than 10^7. 
So you can to handle this problem by checking if N > or < tham 10^7, if it less we do normal sieve else we check 
if therer is any prime devisor less than sqrt of N.
You can take a look in the provided code 3-LargePrimeSieve
